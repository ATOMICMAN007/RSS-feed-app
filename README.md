# RSS Feed App
Simple RSS feed reader for my convenience and learning about RSS feeds in general.

## Ongoing Migration
I'm quite interested in this project because I frequently use RSS readers on my mobile phone. However, due to my limited daily availability, I struggle to consistently dedicate time to searching for optimal approaches to implement new features or advance the project. Consequently, I've made the choice to revamp the project using Django. The primary reason behind this decision is Django's capability to handle complex tasks, ultimately leading to significant time savings for me.
